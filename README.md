Portfolio submission for CS 230: The Gaming Room project.


# CS 230 Portfolio Submission â€“ The Gaming Room Project

## Client Summary
The Gaming Room was the client. They wanted a cross-platform game application called *Draw It or Lose It*, which allows multiple players to join teams and guess images in real time. The system needed to run across web, mobile, and desktop platforms, using secure server-side logic to manage players, teams, and game sessions.

## What I Did Well
I clearly defined the classes and their responsibilities in my design document, explaining how each part of the program works together. I made sure that the Entity, Game, Team, and Player classes share common attributes, while the GameService class manages the overall game logic. I also demonstrated strong understanding of object-oriented programming principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction in my design explanation.

## Helpful Parts of the Design Process
Working through the design document helped me plan before coding. It clarified what each class should do and how the components interact. This made it easier to build the Dropwizard application in Eclipse.

## What I Would Revise
If I could revise one part, I would expand on the section about scalability and data handling to explain how the system could handle more players or future web expansion.

## Understanding and Implementing User Needs
I focused on usability and scalability. Users needed smooth gameplay with unique sessions and fast team joining, so I designed the logic to ensure no duplicate games or teams. Meeting user needs ensures the product is functional and engaging.

## My Approach to Software Design
I broke the problem down into smaller parts, mapped out the classes, and visualized their connections using UML. In the future, Iâ€™ll continue using an iterative design process and user feedback loops to improve both functionality and design clarity.
